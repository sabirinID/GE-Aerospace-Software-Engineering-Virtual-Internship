Task 1: Build a user interface
Create a simple user interface using Vue.js

# Here is the background information on your task
You've recently been hired as a digital technology intern at GE Aerospace. Throughout your internship, you'll rotate through a diverse set of fields, but to start out, you'll be working with software development! As a software developer, you'll be responsible for developing and maintaining GE Aerospace's more than 1000 digital applications.

Before you dive into your first full project, your manager would like you to familiarise yourself with the basic tools that GE Aerospace uses for application development. GE uses a mixture of custom tools and third-party commercial products to build their web applications and analytics platform. One of the many technologies it leverages is Vue.js, a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. This tool uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a framework for efficiently developing component-based user interfaces.

To give you the opportunity to learn about Vue.js, your manager has asked you to make a simple user interface that could be used for a GE application. The page will include a mixture of components, including text, an image, and a button. When the button is pressed, the page will display the product of two numbers.

# Getting started with the task
In this task, you'll be creating a simple user interface with Vue.js. This page will include a title field that reads "Compute Product" as well as an image of your choice. It will also contain a "Compute" button that, when clicked, displays the product of two numbers.

First, review the links below to learn about how to build a user interface with Vue.js. 

# Here are some resources to help you

# Here is your task
Now that you have reviewed the resources, perform the following steps to complete this task:

	1. For this task, you'll be building the user interface in Vue SFC Playground. Navigate to this site and familiarise yourself with the interface. You'll be making edits to the autogenerated App.vue file.
 
	2. Edit the App.vue file to add a heading that reads "Compute Product".
 
	3. Embed an image of your choice. In our example answer, we used this image.

	4. Add variables for the two numbers to be multiplied together. Then, add text to the page that displays these numbers.

	5. Add a compute button. Configure it so that when the button is pressed, the button disappears and is replaced by the text indicating the product of the two numbers.

# Submit your App.vue file below.
Once you've completed all of the task steps, please submit your deliverable.
